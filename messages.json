But on disk, it's just a text file, and filesystems are not designed for efficient insertion of data into the middle of a file, not without very tricky manipulation of the filesystem itself, as the answers here suggest.  Yes, it is inefficient. If you want efficiency, use a database that's designed for updates. However, for relatively small JSON files, this theoretical inefficiency may be meaningless if saving the entire file to disk takes a fraction of a second."}]}
